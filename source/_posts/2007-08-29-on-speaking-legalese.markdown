Who knows how to write a Terms of Service / Privacy Policy?

We're not lawyers, and we really hope we'll never have to meet one in a professional capacity.

Our Terms of Service basically goes (as of now):


> We want to do the right thing with your data. This means we'll keep it as safe as possible and take all the measures we can to make sure it is backed up and available. We'll never sell your personal information either, because we like you.

But in the event things go wrong, you will promise not to hold us accountable.


Now to translate this into legalese...
