A couple of interesting features rolling in:



	
  * I've thrown in print stylesheets for those of you who wanted to quickly print out your sheet without the interface cruft and extraneous navigational elements. Next time you're at a sheet, just hit "print" and you'll see your sheet come out all nice and fresh and clean!

	
  * Hsiu-fan's porting our Javascript code to JQuery. Why? Perhaps he'll explain in an upcoming post...


Some things you guys have requested:

	
  * Easier manipulation/selection of signup cells when you're in the process of creating a sheet.

	
  * Where are those pre-built signup sheets we've promised?!


And some things we've got to get started on:

	
  * A better account interface.

	
  * A better interface to get you started on those pretty-URLs.


And some other news:

	
  * Hsiu-fan's built us a hosted [Rhapsody scrobbler](http://scrobbler.porkbuns.net) in Python and [CakePHP](http://www.cakephp.org). If you're a [Rhapsody](http://www.rhapsody.com) listener who wants to hook up your Rhapsody track history to Audioscrobbler/[Last.fm](http://www.last.fm), he can do that for you.
