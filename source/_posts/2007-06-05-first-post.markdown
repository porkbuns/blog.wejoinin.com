I guess I should start off by saying welcome. We ([Mr. Andrew Hao](http://blog.g9labs.com/), and [Mr. Hsiu-Fan Wang](http://hsiufan.eats.porkbuns.net/)) put together [WeJoinIn](http://www.wejoinin.com/) because we thought we could make a totally sweet signup-sheet thing.

So, I just wanted to tell those who have seen the [frontpage](http://www.wejoinin.com/) and thought "wait, not _everyone_ can sign up! I sure can't!" that you are absolutely right. Unless you were given the [super-secret url to signup](http://www.wejoinin.com/account/sign_up)...
