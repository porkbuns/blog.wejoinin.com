    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been several years since we&rsquo;ve last posted, but we just wanted to
let you know that we&rsquo;re still around, and we&rsquo;re still doing our best to
be relevant to your needs.</p>

<p>Wejoinin, as you may know, has always been a passion project for
Hsiu-Fan and myself, and as so has always been run as a side project.</p>

<p>In this past year, we&rsquo;ve done a lot of infrastructure upgrades to our system:</p>

<ul>
<li>We&rsquo;ve switched out email providers</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ve upgraded parts of our frontend Javascript framework to use React.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ve added new ways for you to chat with us, and we&rsquo;ve done our best
to be responsive as we can. (We know we haven&rsquo;t been as snappy in
responding as we could have been &ndash; we can do better!)</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ve secured the site with industry-standard SSL encryption.</li>
</ul>


<p>Additionally, we had the graces of our intern Eli, who helped us
accomplished a few major things, among them:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sheet archiving and restoring</li>
<li>Refactoring and cleaning up parts of the legacy system that weren&rsquo;t as
clear or as clean as we&rsquo;d like them to be.</li>
<li>Squashing a bunch of bugs!</li>
</ul>


<p>Today, Wejoinin stands still as a volunteer project, steadily humming as it ever
has been since 2006. We also wanted to let you know that we aren&rsquo;t going away
anytime soon. We know you have a lot of ideas for us &ndash; we&rsquo;ve
heard a bunch of them and have a few good ideas up our sleeves.</p>

<p>Where do you want us to go from here? Let us know in our help widget on our site!</p>
