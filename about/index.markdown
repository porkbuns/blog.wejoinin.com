[Wejoinin](http://www.wejoinin.com/) is a way to build and share online signup sheets without having to cry. It's a pet project of some of us here at the [porkbuns initiative](http://www.porkbuns.net/), a group of friends here at UC Berkeley who like to build shiny, friendly things!

If you encounter any problems, please let [Hsiu-Fan](mailto:hsiufan@wejoinin.com) or [Andrew](mailto:andrew@wejoinin.com) know and they promise to help 			you out lickety-split!
