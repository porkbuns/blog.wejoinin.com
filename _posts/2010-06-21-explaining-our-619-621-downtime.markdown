Hey folks,

I wanted to personally apologize to you all again for the site downtime we've experienced this weekend. Our host experienced a perfect storm of denial-of-service attacks and software failures in one of our machines that did not get addressed until early Monday morning. The problem was unfortunately out of our control. We're looking into how we can prevent such scenarios from occurring in the future.

Thanks for understanding. Please don't hesitate to contact me (andrew at wejoinin dot com) if you have any further questions.

-Andrew
