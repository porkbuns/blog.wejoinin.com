All's been quiet here among us at Wejoinin for the past couple months or so. Hsiu-Fan and I have been cranking away in our respective classes and haven't quite gotten the time to get in some work on this application.

However, we're _really_ thankful to those of you who use this site and continue to inform us of broken things and give us suggestions and even tell your friends!

I've [written a little bit about how I'm taking an entrepreneurship class](http://blog.andrewhao.com/2008/03/11/could-i-be-an-entrepreneur/) here at UC Berkeley in the [Center for Entrepreneurship and Technology](http://cet.berkeley.edu). I've definitely been thinking in the past few weeks about how we can take this idea to the rest of the world, one signup at a time.

In class, we've had industry big shots come in and talk a lot about ideation, marketing, distribution strategies, acquiring funding and the like. It's been an eye-opening whirlwind of learning for me.

And even though all this talk about starting a business is dandy, I can't help but feel this greater desire to _build something really sweet_. Today we had [PBWiki](http://www.pbwiki.com) founder David Weekly in class talking about his experience starting the project on his own. And if you've heard it once, you need to hear it again: _It doesn't matter how cool your technology is. All that matters is that you can solve somebody's problem, really really well._

So let's do that. After staying dormant for a while, we think it's time to keep Wejoinin moving forward. Last month, we added a friend and developer [Jason Ting](http://www.phase-4.org) (of [iPhoneSender](http://www.iphonesender.com) fame) to the team. We think he's got a lot of programming and design experience to contribute to the project. We'll have him in here in a little bit to say hi.

Hsiu-Fan and I will drop in here when we have some breathing room to get the rest of this site up and running. Until then, you could do us a great favor by making yourself a sheet and tell us how it's working for you.

Until next time,

-Andrew
