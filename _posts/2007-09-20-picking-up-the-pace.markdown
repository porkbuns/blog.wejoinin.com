Andrew here to remind you gently that Hsiu-Fan and I have not, contrary to popular belief, been hiding under rocks and twiddling our thumbs.

Well, in _some_ sense, we have, because things here at school have been picking up.

But we've noticed that more of you guys have been using the site, and feature requests and bug reports (_find em and let us know!_) have been filing in.

And we've been neglecting this site for far too long. We just turn to each other with graven expressions on our faces and once again begin to kick butt.Â  It's morphin' time! No more dead controllers! Views aplenty! Goodbye text links and bad formatting!

Well, we haven't done it _yet_.

But it's coming. Seriously.
