Wejoinin is definitely growing--so much that we're switching servers again!The good folks at [prgmr.com](http://www.prgmr.com) have offered a [killer deal](http://prgmr.com/xen/) on Xen VPS Web hosting that we just couldn't pass up. In the early morning of Nov. 18, you should expect to see some minor downtime as we get the transition going.Thanks for hanging in there with us! We'll keep you updated as best we can.

--Update: We've postponed the server transfer until we can resolve some deployment issues on our end. We'll keep you notified with any happenings!
