**EDIT: We have completed the switch. As always, please let us know if anything is broken!**





It's been long in the works, but we are finally going through with our server transition. [The last time we planned this out](http://blog.wejoinin.com/2009/11/10/look-out-site-downtime-scheduled-nov-18-1am-pst/), there were a few server issues at our new host that made us hold off the fix. Things have stabilized recently, and we're going to go ahead and make this happen.





_Hsiu-Fan, Jason and Andrew have HENCEFORTH RESOLVED:_





To peform site maintenance on Wejoinin on **Sunday, March 14,** from **2AM-4AM PST**. Did we mention it's pi day?





_BE IT DECLARED:_





That users will see minimal downtime and a nice little feature after the swap!





Thanks for your patience everyone!If you have any questions or concerns about the transition at any time, please feel free to email [me (Andrew)](mailto:andrew@wejoinin.com) or [Hsiu-Fan](mailto:hsiufan@wejoinin.com).
